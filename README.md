## Course Description
Statistics is the exploration of methods for gathering, analyzing, and interpreting data.For instance, it enables you to gauge the probability of product purchases, predict the volume of support calls, and determine optimal inventory sizes for accommodating 95% of customers

## Description of Modules
### Module 1 ðŸ“–
In this module i learned what is statistics, types of Statistics (Descriptive&Inferential), learned and practiced measures of center - mean, median, mode; measures of spread - variance, standard deviation, quantiels, boxplots, interquantile range and learned how to find outliers with statistics.

### Module 2 ðŸ“–
In the second module i learned and practiced Probability, sample and sampling distribution, sampling with and without replacement, learned Discrete and Continious types of distributions, understood how to find probability for each item and visualize it.

### Module 3 ðŸ“–
So, in the module 3 i get familiar with Normal distribution, 68-95-99.7 rule, The central limit theorem - distribution becomes closer to the normal as the number of trials increses, learned what is Poisson distribution, Exponential distribution, Student's t-distribution and Log-normal distribution.

### Module 4 ðŸ“–
The last module, here i learned what is Correlation, correlation coefficient, magnitude of correlation, learned methods to find out how 2 numeric variables are correlated, get familiar with visualization - scatterplot, scatterplot with trendline, i also learned about Correlation caveats and how it can affect on analyzing data, learned about Log transformation and basic understanding of Causation, Association, Confounders and Spurious correlations.

## Used technologies ðŸ› 
Python - scipy.stats, NumPy, Maplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas
